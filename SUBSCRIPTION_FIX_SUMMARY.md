# Subscription Payment Issues - Fix Summary

## Problem
After successful payment using coupon codes in production, user subscription status was not being updated properly, preventing users from accessing premium features.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by missing webhook event handlers for Stripe events that are crucial for coupon code scenarios:

1. **Missing `invoice.payment_succeeded` handler** - This event is sent when payment is successful, including when coupon codes are applied
2. **Missing `invoice.created` handler** - This event can be important for coupon code scenarios
3. **Incomplete error handling** - Webhook handlers didn't have proper error recovery mechanisms
4. **No user creation fallback** - If users didn't exist in the database, the webhook handlers would fail

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Webhook Event Handlers

#### `invoice.payment_succeeded` Handler
- Added comprehensive handler for successful payments
- Retrieves subscription details from Stripe
- Updates user subscription status to 'premium' when payment is successful
- Handles coupon code scenarios properly

#### `invoice.created` Handler  
- Added handler for invoice creation events
- Ensures subscription status is updated even when invoices are created with discounts

### 2. Improved Error Handling and Robustness

#### Enhanced `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted`
- Added user existence check with fallback creation
- Better error logging with session details
- More robust customer validation

#### Enhanced `handleSubscriptionUpdate`
- Added user existence check with fallback creation
- Better error logging with subscription details
- More comprehensive data updates

### 3. Added Debug and Recovery Tools

#### New Endpoints
- `/force-sync-subscription` - Manually sync subscription status from Stripe
- `/debug-subscription` - Debug and fix individual user subscription issues
- `/list-subscription-issues` - List all users with potential subscription issues

#### Debug Utilities (`src/utils/subscriptionDebug.ts`)
- `debugUserSubscription()` - Debug and fix individual user issues
- `listUsersWithSubscriptionIssues()` - Find users with subscription problems

## How to Fix Existing Users

### Option 1: Individual User Fix
```bash
# Call the debug endpoint for a specific user
POST /api/stripe/debug-subscription
Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt-token>
```

### Option 2: Force Sync for User
```bash
# Force sync subscription status
POST /api/stripe/force-sync-subscription
Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt-token>
```

### Option 3: List All Issues
```bash
# List all users with subscription issues
GET /api/stripe/list-subscription-issues
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>
```

## Webhook Events Now Handled

1. `checkout.session.completed` - Initial payment completion
2. `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription creation
3. `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription updates
4. `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancellations
5. `invoice.payment_succeeded` - **NEW** - Successful payments (including coupon codes)
6. `invoice.created` - **NEW** - Invoice creation events
7. `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payments

## Testing the Fix

### For New Users
1. Create a checkout session with a coupon code
2. Complete the payment
3. Verify webhook events are received and processed
4. Check that user subscription status is updated to 'premium'

### For Existing Users
1. Use the debug endpoints to identify affected users
2. Run the force sync or debug subscription endpoints
3. Verify that subscription status is corrected

## Monitoring

Monitor these logs for webhook processing:
- `Processing webhook event: invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `Handling payment success for invoice: <invoice-id>`
- `User subscription updated successfully for payment success, user: <user-id>`

## Prevention

The enhanced webhook handlers now:
- Handle all relevant Stripe events
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Create users if they don't exist in the database
- Provide comprehensive debugging tools

This should prevent similar issues in the future and provide tools to fix any existing affected users.
